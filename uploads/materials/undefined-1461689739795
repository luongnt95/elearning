"""Donald Trump"", unsurprisingly, was the 17th most viewed article of 2015, during which it accrued over 14 million views. In the four weeks it has stood at #1 on this list, the article has garnered nearly 21 million views. If that number were included in last year's list, it would be at #5. Just for the last four weeks. So completely has Trump fused together the two principal preoccupations of our viewership (current events and entertainment) that it is simply impossible to know which reason is driving them more. Do our viewers see his presidential campaign as a genuine epochal shift in the political landscape of the US? Or simply as yet another reality TV show? Come the end of year one of President Trump's administration, it will be interesting to see if the show is still going."

"Seventeen began. Three remain. So-called ""Super Tuesday II"" fell on the 15th, with Trump storming every state and territory except Ohio, which was won by its current governor, John Kasich; much, I am sure, to his relief, as he had said he would drop out if it was not. Poor Marco Rubio had not said he would drop out if he lost his home state of Florida, but did so anyway when he did. With the contest quiet until the next big primary push on the 22nd, and debates apparently over, the Presidential election has entered a kind of surreal cruise control, as the country waits to see if Trump can reach that magic number of 1237 delegates he needs to secure the nomination without a brokered convention."

And then he won nine states in one week, and the laughter ceased, for there was no one left who saw the joke. With the Republican field apparently narrowing to a choice between Trump and Ted Cruz, a choice Republican Senator Lindsey Graham memorably compared to ""being shot or poisoned"", that low-profile cadre of patricians known as the Republican establishment have apparently realised at last that he has a realistic shot of becoming their party's nominee, whether they like it or not.

But while that film was critically reviled, its win widely seen as an insult to the then-frontrunner High Noon, in this case the Academy seem to have aimed above their usual middlebrow consensus and gone for quality. The film, about Boston Globe journalists uncovering evidence of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, was the most critically praised of all the Best Picture nominees, while the presumed frontrunner, The Revenant, was the most critically disliked, with a 76 on Metacritic and an 82% RT score vs 93 and 96% for Spotlight.

John McCain called him a ""whacko bird""; John Boehner called him a ""jackass"", and even fellow Texan and former boss George W. Bush admitted, ""I just don't like the guy"". He spearheaded a highly unpopular government shutdown in an ultimately failed attempt to stop Obamacare; he has openly embraced organizations that call for the execution of homosexuals and abortion doctors, and he actively disbelieves in the existence of man-made climate change. And yet it is this very antipathy he has generated that seems to have energised his popularity among America's most conservative voters, particularly those of a Christian fundamentalist bent, as voters across the political spectrum turn in rage against ""the Establishment.""

If he sees his shadow, he goes back in; if he doesn't, he comes out. Coming out heralds an early spring; staying in means six more weeks of winter. The custom is strongest in Pennsylvania, where it originated, and particularly Punxsutawney, home of the world's most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, who speaks his forecast in Groundhogese into the ear of the chairman of the Groundhog Club Inner Circle, who then translates for the audience.

His career was a kaleidoscope of reinventions; not just of music and appearance but of persona, profession and gender identity, each time anticipating the reactions of his audience, and usually forcing them to catch up with him. Fiercely intelligent and unafraid to show it, he also anticipated the effects of technological change, releasing Space Oddity five days before the launch of Apollo 11, and using the Internet to interact with fans years before the age of social media. His work as an actor also frequently ran leaps ahead of audiences, whether as an alien in Nicolas Roeg's initially ill-regarded but now lauded The Man Who Fell To Earth, or as Jareth the Goblin King in Jim Henson's Labyrinth, a critical bomb that would go on to become a fixture of children's video libraries, and earn him an entire new generation of fans. But his death earlier this month at the age of 69 may prove his greatest leap ahead yet; while ill with cancer for the preceding 18 months, he refused to publicise his condition and instead used his last time on Earth to compose Blackstar, one of his best reviewed albums in decades. Just as Bowie lived as art, he died as art, and the video for ""Lazarus"", the second single from Blackstar, which featured a suddenly aged Bowie blindfolded on a hospital bed, would become an epitaph to the world. Once again, we had to catch up with him, and the shock of his unexpected death shivered across his pan-generational fanbase, pushing Blackstar to #1 in the US album chart, astoundingly for the first time, and giving him not only the highest single-day tally of YouTube VEVO views ever recorded, but also, incidentally, the first ever eight-figure weekly Wikipedia viewcount, with over 11.7 million views on last week's chart."

And no one noticed it being built. Apparently. Despite being a wanted fugitive, he later found time to openly gloat about his trafficking achievements to Sean Penn in an interview for Rolling Stone.
